## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation

`git clone https://gitlab.com/feloniousbonk/st-bonk.git` 

Clone this repository into desired directory e.g. `~/.local/share/` or `~/.config/`

Edit the file `config.def.h` to configure st.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st:
```bash
$ sudo make clean install
```
**NOTE**: After installation the file `config.h` will be created, do not edit this file if you wish to make any further changes. Always edit the file `config.def.h`. Then remove the `config.h` file and install your st build again as so:

```bash
$ rm config.h

$ sudo make install
```
This will recompile st with your updated changes and create a new `config.h` file each time.

## Xresources
Various options can be configured from `~/.Xresources` using the syntax `st.option: value`:
- `font`
- `color0 ` to `color15`
- `foreground`
- `background`
- `cursor` - cursor color
- `reverseCursor` - reverse cursor color
- `termname`
- `shell`
- `xfps` - frames per second st should at maximum draw to the screen
- `actionfps`
- `blinktimeout` - blinking timeout (set to 0 to disable blinking) for the terminal blinking attribute
- `bellvolume`
- `tabspaces`
- `borderpx`
- `cwscale` - Kerning / character bounding-box multipliers
- `chscale`

After updating `~/.Xresources`, remember to execute the command:
```bash
$ xrdb ~/.Xresources
```
or else your changes will not show up.

## Right click to plumb

Inspired by plan9's acme and plumber: right-click some selected text to send it to the plumbing program of your choosing:
  
- open an URL in a browser
- view an image, PDF, ...
- jump from logs to editor, at the specified line/col
- etc

You can set the command to execute in the `config.def.h` variable (`static char *plumber_cmd = " "`), The default is `"xdg-open %s"`, which opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application.

## Blinking cursor
Edit: (`static unsigned int cursorshape = [1-7]`) in your `config.def.h` file to set any of the following cursors: 

  1. Blinking Block ("█")
  2. Block ("█")
  3. Blinking Underline ("_")
  4. Underline ("_")
  5. Blinking Bar ("|")
  6. Bar ("|")
  7. Snowman ("☃")

## AnyGeometry
set st's width and height as pixels instead of cells, both from the command line:
```bash
$ st -G [width]x[height]
```
or the `config.def.h` file variables: 
 
 * `static Geometry geometry = PixelGeometry;` 
 
 * `static unsigned int width = x;` 
 
 * `static unsigned int height = x;`

\* set (`static Geometry geometry = CellGeometry;`) to set size by cell instead of pixels.

## Disable Bold and Italic fonts
Get rid of bold, italic, and roman fonts for a cleaner looking prompt by setting the following `config.def.h` variables to (**1**):

  * `int disablebold = 1;`

  * `int disableitalic = 1;`

  * `int disableroman = 1;`

\* set to (**0**) to enable each if desired.

## Desktop Entry
The shell script `desktopentry.sh` is a quick and dirty shell script that creates a `st.desktop` file @ `~/.local/share/applications`
and installs it to your system, without having to patch st itself. This allows st to be accessible from your desktop/application launcher

**Requirements**:  

  * `desktop-file-utils`

run by entering:
```bash
$ bash ./desktopentry.sh
```
